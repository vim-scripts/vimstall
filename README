Vimstall is a script to install vim plugins automatically.

Syntax:
	vimstall.sh <filename>|<dirname>

If you run the script on filename it is treated as vim plugin, if run on directory
it will try to install all files from this directory like they all are vim plugins.

Vimstall supports vimballs (vim is run to install them), simple vim files
(they are treated as sinlge plugin and are copied into ~/.vim/plugin/ directory
and packed files (zips & tarballs) in which case archive must contain either
vim/vimball file or packed installation of a plugin (i.e. directories to put into
~/.vim like `doc', `plugin', `autoload' etc.)

If during installation process the script runs into some unknown file, it will
report this file's name into stderr.

This script can be used with `downloadvimscripts' script to update & install
vim plugins automatically.

Please note: this script is *beta* and not well tested in all configurations.
I tried to handle most package types met on vim.org, so it should work fine
most of time (and it works for me :), but it is strongly advised to backup
your ~/.vim directory before you run this script.

Best used with downloadvimscripts (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2444).
